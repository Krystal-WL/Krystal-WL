### Hi there 👋

Hello👋, I'm Krystal Lin. Currently, I'm enhancing my Data Science expertise at [the University of Toronto Data Science Institute](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/),  driven by my experience in Project Management and Data Analysis at [ALCLE](https://www.alclecanada.com/) and an Earth Sciences degree from [the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).  I'm particularly passionate about big data analytics and data visualization, aiming to contribute meaningfully in these fields.

🌱 Outside of data, I love travel and photography, enriching my perspective.
