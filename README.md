### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

HelloðŸ‘‹, I'm Krystal Lin. Currently, I'm deepening my expertise in Data Science at [the University of Toronto Data Science Institute](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/),  propelled by a diverse foundation in Project Management and Data Analysis at [ALCLE](https://www.alclecanada.com/) and an Earth Sciences degree from [the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). My areas of keen interest include big data analytics and data visualization, where I'm eager to make significant contributions.

ðŸŒ± Outside of data, I love travel and photography, enriching my perspective.
